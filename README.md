# NCTU EE 2016 Spring Computer Organization Final Project
This program will blur and sharpen three images under directory "Images" respectively and save the results in directory "Output".

Your job is to improve the cache perfromance on the riscv-isa-simulator, spike, through software and hardware (modify the simulator) appraoches.

## Introduction
Image bluring/unsharping are very useful techniques used often in daily life to remove noise and enhance image quality. They are basically doing 2D convolution with a low-pass/high-pass filter onto an image. Please check the following links to obtain more information: [convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution), [bluring](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/gsmooth.htm) and [unsharping](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/unsharp.htm).
